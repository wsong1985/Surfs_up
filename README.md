# Surfs_up

## **Overview of Surfs up Project**

### Provide the Summary Statistics for June and December to assist W. Avy in determining if her surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## **Results**

- **Filtered the date column of the Measurements table in the database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. Stored in DataFrame and generated the summary statistics.**

- **Calculated the difference of Min temperature, the difference of Max temperature, and the difference of average temperature between June and December.**

## **Summary**

- **Upon comparing the Min, Max and Average temperature of June and December, we see no significant changes in temperature. This means that W. Avy's surf and ice cream is potentially sustainable year-round.**
  
- **To provide a further understanding of the temperature in June, we conducted a data count to show how often the temperature is above the average during the month of June. We can see that 966 out 0f 1517 records exceeded the average temperature.**

- **To provide an insight of how the precipitation effects the business in December, we conducted a study of total precipitation in the month of December.**
